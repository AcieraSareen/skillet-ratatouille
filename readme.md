It’s a great way to use up a bundle of peak summer produce. You can also double the stew and refrigerate up to 1 week ahead, then serve as is, spooned over polenta, or with baked chicken or fish. You want a hearty stew consistency rather than a soup here; reserving 1/2 cup of the canned tomato liquid will be just enough. If you’d like to use fresh ripe tomatoes, start with 2 pounds, halving and seeding 1 pound before dicing.
